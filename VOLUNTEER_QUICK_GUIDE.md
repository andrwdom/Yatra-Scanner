## ⌨️ When QR Doesn't Work

### Manual Entry
1. Click **⌨️ Manual** tab
2. Ask attendee for 6-digit code
3. Type or tap numbers on keypad
4. Auto-submits when 6 digits entered

---

## 🔍 When to Use Search

Use **🔍 Search** tab if:
- Attendee says "I scanned already but..."
- Need to look up someone's ticket
- Want to check status before scanning

### How to Search:
1. Click **🔍 Search** tab
2. Type: Email OR 6-digit code
3. Click "Search"
4. Results show ticket status

## 🚨 When to Call Admin

**Call admin if attendee says:**
- "My QR is damaged/not working" → Try manual code first
- "I got rejected but I have a valid ticket" → Call admin
- "There's been a mistake" → Call admin
- "Can you check my status?" → Use search first

**NEVER:**
- Let someone in if scanner shows RED
- Override the system yourself
- Scan tickets "just to check"

## 📱 Screen Colors Meaning

### 🟢 GREEN = ENTRY ALLOWED
**What it shows:**
- "ENTRY ALLOWED"

**What you do:**

## ⚡ Speed Tips

1. **Have attendees ready:** QR code out, screen brightness up
2. **Manual mode:** Faster for reading codes than scanning
3. **Keep scanning:** Don't stop to chat after each entry
4. **Use search rarely:** Only when needed, slows down line
